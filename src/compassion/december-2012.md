Title: Merry Christmas Per
Date: 2012-12-04

Dear Per,
Merry Christmas!  I'm so excited for this month because Christmas is my favorite holiday of the year.  I love Christmas not because of presents or Christmas treats but because of how it reminds me of Jesus' birth.  Every year, I am so blessed to remember how Jesus came to Earth as a baby to save me from my sin.  This year, I'm planning on going home to visit my friends and family and also help give food to people who are hungry.

Christmas here in California isn't that cold - it never snows here and doesn't rain too much.  Sometimes I wish there was snow so I could play in it but then I am thankful that I don't have to wear a lot of clothes to keep warm.  How is the Christmas weather like for you in Thailand?

Do you have any Christmas plans coming up?  What do you usually do for Christmas?  And is Christmas a big holiday in Thailand or do you have one that you like better?

I hope you and your family are doing well!

LOVE!
Isaac
